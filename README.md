# Employee-Attrition-Analytics-Dashboard---Power-BI-DAX-
Developed an interactive Power BI attrition dashboard analyzing role, grade, tenure, and performance. Built 4 KPIs with slicers and drill-down (Role→Grade→Tenure). Created heatmaps and matrices to identify high-risk segments and attrition hotspots across business units and cities.
Designed a single-page interactive HR attrition dashboard analyzing attrition patterns across organizational, tenure, performance, managerial, demographic, and location dimensions (Themes 1–4).
Built executive-level KPI cards for Total Employees, Attrited Employees, Attrition Rate (%), and Average Tenure, enabling high-level workforce stability monitoring.
Developed attrition segmentation visuals including:
1. Role-wise attrition rate with drill-down hierarchy (Role → Grade → Tenure Band)
2. Role × Grade heatmap (matrix) using conditional formatting to identify high-risk role-grade combinations
3. Tenure band attrition distribution to detect early attrition risk windows
Implemented performance & reward alignment analysis using:
1. Rating vs Attrition
2. Average Salary Hike (Attrited vs Retained)
3. Rating × Hike interaction matrix
Analyzed managerial impact using:
1. Attrition by Reporting Authority
2. Staff Action vs Attrition (100% stacked column chart) to compare proportional attrition risk
3. Integrated Theme 4 demographic & geographic insights via:
4. Age group distribution
5. Gender-based attrition view
6. Education-wise attrition contribution (treemap)
7. City-wise attrition analysis (map)
Created global slicers (Business Unit, Role, Grade, City, Gender, Tenure Band) ensuring cross-filtering and interactive exploration for stakeholders.
